Final Proposal: Recipe Recommender

1. Describe your techniques: break the data pipeline into portions and describe each one.
  Pipeline
    A. Data Collection
      - 3 Data Types Needed
          1. Recipes
            Source(s):
              - AllRecipes.com
              - SpoonacularAPI
            Status:
              - Initial scrape of allrecipes.com and data cleaning. Data stored in MongoDB.
              - Approved for academic use of Spoonacular API
          2. Deals/ Coupons
            Source(s):
              - Ibotta
                  (Backups: scrape Ibotta website or King Soopers/Safeway sites)
                  - Ibotta uses ajax so i'm working on cracking that code right now
            Status:
              - Emails out to Ibotta via Frank
          3. Customer Purchase History
            Source(s):
              - Ibotta
                  (Backups: Create fake user history. This may take a long time.)

    B. Clean Data
      - NLP tools
        https://github.com/zipfian/nlp

    C. Create Recommender
      - Lots of research still need to be done here on what my options are.
      - How to make the recommender take feedback into account.
      - I want the recommender to not just take in the user's history and likes but also on sale items so Ibotta can sell more featured products.

    D. Web app presentation
      - Login as fake 'Ibotta' user
      - Make recipe recommendations based on previous purchase history, likes, and on-sale items.

2. Can you anticipate problems, what are they, do you need to overcome them now? How do you overcome them?

  The largest problem I anticipate thus far is Ibotta not wanting to share either their user data or their on sale item data. In this event, I will be able to scrape grocery sale data from the Ibotta site directly or other couponing site. However, getting enough user data to develop a 'taste' profile for a user will be difficult. Worst case I will have to make up some users or see if I can find other data on the internet.

3. How far do you anticipate to take the project in the allotted time frame?
Any other repos, libraries and other tools that you're considering using? Are you citing them? Are you acknowledging them for their contribution?

    The repo I've referenced so far is Michael Lewis's ChefNet project. Specifically his recipe scraper. https://github.com/Mikelew88/ChefNet

4. Data

    A. Initial test scrape of recipe data has been performed and is available in a MongoDB.
    B. Have not yet tried collecting other data, though am waiting to hear back from Ibotta.
